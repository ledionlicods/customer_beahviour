# customer_behavior
Analyzing retail customers and predicting their behavior using data mining and Machine Learning tools 

In this project we used different clustering algorithms like K-Means, K-Medeoids, DBSCAN and agglomerative clustering on the clients and compared their performance.
In the second step of the project we use different ML algorithms like KNN, SVM and neural networks.
In the last part , we utilize and optimize Prohet time series model to improve sales prediction accuracy.
