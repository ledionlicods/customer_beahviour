# ANALYZING RETAIL CUSTOMERS AND PREDICTING THEIR BEHAVIOR USING DATA MINING AND MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS (2019 PROJECT)

## Clustering
In the first, we will first aggregate the data from a real department store  in multiple dimensions. 
Then we will build several clustering models and analyse their performance on this real data.
 We will conclude, in what is the best model that can be used for department stores based on their characteristics.

##Classification
In the second part of the study, we will propose different classification models with the aim to predict the customer label at the end of the year based on quarterly data. 
The models will be based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)  neural networks and XGBoost algorithms.
 The customer label is a number allocated to each customer based on their annual expenses. Or models will be trained and tested in our dataset. 
 Their performance will be evaluated on accuracy percentage metric.

## Time Series
In the third part of our study, we will analyse time series models and particularly propose a modified Prophet model to predict daily sales in the department stores.
 The base prophet model and the modified one will be evaluated based on prediction MAE (Mean Absolute Error). 
 The modified model will be trained and tested in the sales of the department store from 2011-2019 and its performance will be evaluated bases on prediction MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).


## Status
Clustering, NN and Prophet implementation and optimization are uploaded.
SVM and XGBoost implementation and result graphs will be uploaded soon.
