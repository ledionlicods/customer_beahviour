# customer_behavior
Analyzing retail customers and predicting their behavior using data mining and Machine Learning tools (2019 project)


In this project we used different clustering algorithms like K-Means, K-Medeoids, DBSCAN and agglomerative clustering on the clients and compared their performance.
We also deploy and compare some baseline models like KNN ,SVM and simple Neural Networks to classify the clients.
In the last part , we utilize and optimize Prophet time series model to improve sales prediction accuracy.We than compare the base model to the optimized model based on MAPE metric.
Clustering, NN and Prophet implementation and optimization are uploaded.
SVM and XGBoost implementation and result graphs will be uploaded soon.
